This is the code of our developed smarthome using FPGA and Arduino
 ////////////// Parts Used/////////////////
• We used a motion sensor (E18 D08nk) that is used to detect movement and a led to
light up.
• RFID was used (RC522) to scan the card and open the door where it reads cards
emitting frequencies (13.56 MHZ) only.
• A servo Motor (Micro Servo SG90) was used to open the door
• A button was used to control opening door from inside remotely
• 2 Leds were used to light up in front of door and inside the room
• A switch (SW0) from the FPGA was also used
